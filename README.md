Important : if you intend to use this app, please first modify app settings in Garmin Connect depending on your euc.

This is a standalone application that works with Begode, Leaperkim, Kingsong, inmotion V11 & V12 wheels and VESC based PEV.

This project is originally based on the WheelLog Garmin companion (developed by ggoraa). I modified the UI and coded the Bluetooth communication part and other features (greatly simplified thanks to the developers of WheelLog, to Freestyl3r and to jim_m_58).

Main screen currently display PWM (or duty cycle) on the top arc. The red zone in background correspond to PWM 80 to 100 (if you own a begode, perform a freespin test and set the calculated PWM settings before use). Battery and temperature are shown on the two other arcs.

Wheel settings are accessible using the menu button directly on the watch.

When on the main screen, swiping up brings the activity recording view that allows to start recording/stoping & saving a riding session (only works if you watch has a touchscreen, but you can also map a button to display this view).
